Notes:

Two sections:

/employees
/positions

Database: SQLite

Bank account is string because it can start with zero - as I found out the hard way when Comcast website

Link Employee and Position areas in Views
Add more specs for controllers and models
Show more fields on position show page
Add more formatting
Install rubocop and brakeman
